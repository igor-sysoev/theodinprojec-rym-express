Man. This one's kinda whack and it doesn't really show how much i put into this bastard of a tutorial, I just can't help but wonder how much time something more complex would take. Also, I hate handlebars, half of my time was probably wasted on figuring out the god-afwul absolutely-no-logic-style syntax. Maybe I just don't get it yet. Mongobd seems cool though and it's nice to finally dip my toes into my first database
